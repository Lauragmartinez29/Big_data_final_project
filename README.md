# BIG DATA FINAL PROJECT

Laura García Martínez 
José Javier Tejeda Sánchez 

In this project, we are given a dataset of X-ray images that show a healthy state and pneumonia. The objective of the project is to train a neural network model with the images to be able to make a more accurate diagnosis of pneumonia by performing an X-ray test.

## Models
We tried three different applications of the model but we found several errors that we couldn't solve. In the first try P1, we could fit the model, but applying the estimator to the test dataset gave an error. The second try P2 is based on the teacher's jupyter notebook but unfortunately, fitting the model gives an error. Finally, the thrid try P3, also gives an error in the fitting process.
